#+TITLE: lunanode-cli

* About

This is my fun project for studying and practicing lisp while building something
potentially useful.

* Installing

** Requirements

  - ~sbcl~ >= 2.2.6 (and quicklisp)
  - ~make~ >= 4.3

** Building

There are no release mechanism in-place yet, so please build `lunanode-cli` with
a simple make command:

#+begin_src shell
make bin/lunanode-cli
#+end_src


* Usage

The credentials to access lunanode services can be provided as either
environment variables *${API_ID}* and *${API_KEY}*, or via command-line
arguments (not recommended).

Only a few of the lunanode service interfaces have been implemented as commands,
notably some operations on the /virtualmachine/ and /image/ services.
